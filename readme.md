# Library Book Due Checker
## Project Description
This project is the first one to be modular by design.

The project is separated into five different files:
- index.php: The main html file.
- form.php: The form used to input your data.
- display.php: The display that's used to show all the needed results.
- functions.php: The "brain" of the whole project, mainly responsible for function calls and logic.
- styles.css: The stylesheet used for the html segments.

The main point of it is that this project takes the return and due dates of a library book, checks them against each other (to see if the book is overdue, not yet due, or due today), and displays both them (separately) and the time difference between them.
